1) Are there any customers that have never placed an order?
SELECT * FROM [Customers]
WHERE CustomerID not in(SELECT CustomerID FROM [Orders]) or
SELECT * FROM [Customers]
LEFT JOIN Orders On Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID
WHERE Orders.CustomerID IS NULL

2) What does the distribution of revenues from orders look like?
CREATE TABLE Revenues (
OrderID int,
Revenue decimal
)
INSERT INTO Revenues
SELECT OrderDetails.OrderID as OrderID, SUM(OrderDetails.Quantity*Products.Price) as Revenue FROM Orderdetails
LEFT JOIN Orders
ON Orders.OrderID=OrderDetails.OrderID
LEFT JOIN Products
ON Products.ProductID=OrderDetails.ProductID
Group by OrderDetails.OrderID
SELECT count(case when 0<= Revenue and Revenue <=4000 then Revenue End) as in_range_0_4000,
count(case when 4000< Revenue and Revenue <=8000 then Revenue End) as in_range_4000_8000, 
count(case when 8000< Revenue and Revenue <=12000 then Revenue End) as in_range_8000_12000, 
count(case when 12000< Revenue and Revenue <=16000 then Revenue End) as in_range_12000_16000, 
count(case when 16000< Revenue and Revenue <=20000 then Revenue End) as in_range_16000_20000
From Revenues
Itâ€™s a right-skewed distribution.

3) How many orders do we have?
SELECT count(distinct(OrderID)) FROM OrderDetails

4) What are our top 10 customers (by revenue)?
SELECT OrderID FROM [Revenues] Order by Revenue desc limit 10
